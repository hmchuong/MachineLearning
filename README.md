This repository is my experiments on machine learning - deep learning problem with Tensorflow framework

The requirements:
- Tensorflow: `1.7.0`
- Numpy: `1.14.2`

This repository includes:
1. [Cobb - Douglas function with Linear Regression](https://github.com/hmchuong/MachineLearning/blob/master/LinearRegression_Cobb-Douglas.ipynb)
